Database Positioning:
Establish a database based on some important and specific academic classification methods in contemporary art, and further establish a more efficient and transparent art-related search and research platform.

Solve the problem:
Due to the deep-rooted circle phenomenon in the art industry, the information cocoon effect is obvious, and curators lack an effective way to keep in touch with new works and artists. (Of course, the formation of this phenomenon has its more complicated benefits and social reasons. An open database can only open up a possibility technically and provide a more transparent and open source of information. Open source databases have The freedom of data use and tool openness. For example, tool designers can design tools that are more conducive to recommending local artists or young artists based on the information provided by this data.)

For young curators, the artist's contact information can be quickly found on the platform, which makes up for the lack of resources of artists who just joined the artist. For young artists, it is also a more effective way to actively present their work in front of curators and researchers.

The database will be gradually translated into English, providing a fast way for international curators and art practitioners to access the latest Chinese contemporary art.

As a search tool, it greatly facilitates curatorial and research work around the subject. But at the same time, it also puts forward requirements for curators to build more rich and varied exhibitions.

Compared with other databases:
There are mainly two types of databases accessible to the public. The first type is open APIs for art museums (Met, Tate, etc.) and websites (artsy, artlinkart, etc.). This type of database rarely targets contemporary art, and To ensure objectivity, only absolutely objective information (location, time, materials, etc.) is provided. The other is a relatively complete electronic archive. This type of database is designed to completely record the text, sound, and graphics of the work. APIs made with objective data do not provide effective information with contemporary perspectives, and complete and complex information often results in failures in indexing information.

The questionnaire survey tries to focus on several core information that curators pay attention to when looking for works, and puts the focus of data collection on the content and framework of the works. Artists are invited to answer directly and used as a filter for the quick search function of the collection database. When writing the questionnaire, I try to keep the time for the artist to fill in a single work between 5 and 10 minutes, and try to strike a balance between the time cost of the artist and the effectiveness of the database.

Some of the questions in the questionnaire revolve around creative ideas and background, which may make the artist feel self-labeled. What needs to be explained is that this is a database created for the purpose of searching, the purpose of which is to improve the efficiency of information transfer, and it is necessary to summarize complex information into indexable keywords. For users, this database serves as a quick entry point, and the content is not directly useful for research materials and viewing works.


Possible applications
1. As a secondary curatorial and research tool, use themes, quoted texts, and work categories as filter criteria.
2. As a data research tool, it can be used for further data analysis and visualization.
3. Various auxiliary tools and website redevelopment.
