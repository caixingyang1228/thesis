**Graduation work research direction**

Many works in contemporary art are based on ideas and dematerialized practices.

The channel for the commercialization of contemporary art is still galleries, a very traditional sales model. Collectors are expected to collect value-saving traditional media works, such as paintings. It is often irreproducible (unique) and enjoyable (viewable multiple times). The gallery's business model is actually not suitable for new media art works.

The gallery still sells new media works in the mode of printmaking, making the sales situation difficult. The artist eventually had to turn to making some kind of "by-product." That is, images or sculptures based on his reputation.

My research project is to study music, film and other related industries and find a new model suitable for the commercialization of new media art.
